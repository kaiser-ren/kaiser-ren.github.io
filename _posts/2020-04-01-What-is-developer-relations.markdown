I work as this title for a long time, Developer Relations Manager. There are some points I think they are worth to be shared.

- DevRel, in theory, is the intersection of three disciplines: engineering, marketing, and community management;
- I like to describe the role as having three pillars: Three Cs: code, content, and community. Code is maybe open source projects, or quick starts examples. Content is blog posts, tutorials, talks, that kind of stuff. And then community is working with people in person or online, maybe Twitter or Stack Overflow.
- DevRel, in theory, is the intersection of three disciplines: engineering, marketing, and community management;
- To the community I represent the company, to the company I represent the community, and I must have both of their interests in mind at all times;
- At its core, Developer Relations is best defined as building relationships with the developer community. It is acting as the liaison between your company and existing developer communities.
- To complicate matters, each company seems to have its own idea of what Developer Relations - is—whether it’s product, outbound marketing, sales, talent acquisition, PR, or engineering. The truth is, a successful Developer Relations program isnone of these and all of these.
